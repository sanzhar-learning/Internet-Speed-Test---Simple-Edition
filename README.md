# Complited functionality and approximate grades from your perception
- user starts with the entering his name and then typing 'start' - otherwise the program won't run
- then program measures the speed of the internet and gets location of the user, then stores it in CSV file.
- Location data is provided by an external API (ipinfo.io). Because IP-based geolocation is not always accurate, the returned city/region may sometimes be approximate or incorrect. This does not affect program functionality.


## TODO
- Todo-list: 
- use Speedtest Client library for, well, measure download and upload speed 
- also create a CSV file storing the data of each user who ran this program.
